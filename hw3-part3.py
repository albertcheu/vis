#scatter plot: assessed value against total living area
#each point is a black circle
#fill white for oldest
#fill black for newest
#for intermediary values, interpolate luminance between


#bar chart: number of buildings with each A/C type
#Blue-Black-Red color indicates A/C type


#find the q-tiles of the assessed values
#map each q-tile to a color on the red-blue gradient
#stacked bar plot: bar height is number of buildings with each view quality
#blue-red color gradient encodes distribution of assessed value
